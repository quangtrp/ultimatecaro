## Introduction

This is a tic-tac-toe gaming website and it's also my third personal project. I worked on this project for 2 weeks (September 5 to September 13). I designed the entire interface layout of this website using `ReactJS` and `SCSS`. To make this website more diverse, I have researched and added a fighting game mode against the computer. Also, I've built this website to be responsive so we can access it by phone or tablet.

## Rules to play

Whoever gets 5 consecutive squares in the same row or diagonal wins

### Note: 
If you reach five cells in the same row that are blocked at both ends, you have not won.

## How to play

Choose which mode do you want to play (PvsP or PvsC)

### PVSP (Player Vs Player)

This mode is suitable for 2 players with 1 device. The first player will represent the O and the second will be the X. Each player will take turns to mark O or X.

### PVSC (Player Vs Computer)

This mode is suitable for playing alone. You will represent O and you will face the computer representing X. You will be the first to mark. This mode can also help you train your thinking ability and the ability to predict the computer's moves, so you can have your own unique gaming strategies.

## Technologies

I built this website with ReactJS, SCSS
